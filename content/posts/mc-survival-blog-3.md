I almost forgot about this Blog. Anyways, I was really scared. This is why:

I got full iron(As you guys remembered), and found some diamonds which is epic. I made a diamond pick and mine some obsidian, Went to nether, got some quartz, and When I came back to the portal, I got back to my base, except... when I walked out I got teleported into another place. I was like "What Happened?", I checked and I was like 10k blocks away. and There was no nether portal. so I tried going back to my old cords. Oh boy, it was scary.

I went to a forest because there is no other way to go back, and this is where the spooky stuff happens.

I found a sign that said: (Hexadecimal)

I broke it because I was scared. This was singleplayer and I haven't even travelled this far before. I keep walking, and walking, and walking. I feel like I was being spied on. so I tried to run.

I heard footsteps behind me so I run As Fast as Possible. I tried to press F5, but my game crashed.

I'm now here. writing this blog. I'm tempted to delete this world. Please, Help me.
